## Project Brief

The objective of this project wass to design an Android app that can be used to showcase/sell some products and items. Some similar apps can be used for inspiration, like Trade Me, and AliExpress. Your app should consist of at least three activities; a MainActivity, ListActivity, and DetailsActivity, as well as some form of search functionality.

## App Introduction

Desktop computers are ubiquitous, and consist of various components. Components are modular and can be changed to build faster, more efficient computers. However, sometimes it is difficult to find components that work together. The purpose of our Android application is to sell various computer hardware items. All the items featured in our application will be compatible with each other so users can be assured that the products they buy will have no compatibility issues. The app will initially have three different categories, CPUs, GPUs and Monitors. Each category will have at least ten unique items.

## Summary

Working in a pair to create an Android app was a great time and taught me valuable skills of working with Android Studio, Java, and XML. The app doesn't function as an actual shopping app, but this was outside of the scope of the project. All UI Design and transitions were completed by us, as well as the general user flow. It was super interesting being able to finally learn about Android App development, as phones play such an integral role in day to day life. It was very enlightening, and gave me an appreciation for app development and how difficult it can be to design even the smallest app we use.
